This is a basic mobile application built with Expo and React Native. 
The React Navigation library is used for navigation, and I am working on nesting routes with React Navigation tabs.

The goal of this project is to improve my skills in Expo, React Native, and React Navigation. I am also using an API key to fetch some photos from Pexels to display in my mobile application. The API key is hidden in the env.tsx file, and this file is not committed to the repository, so no one can see or use it on GitHub.
